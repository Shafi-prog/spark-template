- **Design Personality**: Professional yet approachable, with clear authority indicators for security
- **Visual Metaphors**: Traffic flow, digital queues, secure handoffs
- **Simplicity Spectrum**: Clean and minimal to reduce cognitive load during time-sensitive operations

### Color Strategy
- **Color Scheme Type**: Triadic (blue primary, green secondary, orange accent)
- **Primary Color**: Deep blue (oklch(0.45 0.15 240)) - represents trust, security, educational authority
- **Secondary Colors**: Forest green (oklch(0.55 0.12 140)) - represents approval, safety, go-ahead states
- **Accent Color**: Warm orange (oklch(0.65 0.14 50)) - represents attention, pending states, important actions
- **Color Psychology**: Blue builds trust with parents and staff, green provides clear positive feedback, orange ensures important actions aren't missed
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**: 
  - White backgrounds with dark blue text (4.8:1 contrast)
  - Blue backgrounds with white text (10.2:1 contrast)
  - Orange accent with white text (4.7:1 contrast)

### Typography System
- **Font Pairing Strategy**: Single font family (Cairo) with varied weights for hierarchy
- **Primary Font**: Cairo - specifically designed for Arabic with excellent Latin support
- **Typographic Hierarchy**: 
  - Headers: Cairo 600-700 weight
  - Body: Cairo 400 weight  
  - Captions: Cairo 300 weight
- **Typography Consistency**: Maintain 1.5x line height for body text, 1.2x for headers

### Accessibility & Readability
- **Contrast Goal**: WCAG AA compliance minimum (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
- **Arabic Typography**: Proper RTL layout with optimized font rendering
- **Large Touch Targets**: Minimum 44px touch areas for all interactive elements
- **Clear Visual Hierarchy**: Distinguished states for pending, approved, active, and completed requests

## Implementation Considerations
- **Real-time Synchronization**: WebSocket connections for live updates across all apps
- **GPS Integration**: Geofencing for automatic request activation
- **Offline Capability**: Critical functions work without internet
- **Multi-language Support**: Arabic primary, English secondary
- **Security First**: All student transfers require explicit verification
