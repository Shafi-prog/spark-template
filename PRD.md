## Design Direction

The interface should evoke trust, efficiency, and modernity - feeling professional yet approachable like premium educational technology. The design should be minimalist but information-rich to serve the complex coordination requirements without overwhelming users.

## Color Selection

Triadic color scheme - three equally spaced colors provide visual distinction for different user roles and status indicators while maintaining harmony and accessibility.

- **Primary Color**: Deep Blue `oklch(0.45 0.15 240)` - communicates trust, security, and educational authority
- **Secondary Colors**: Warm Green `oklch(0.55 0.12 140)` for success/approval states and Warm Orange `oklch(0.65 0.14 60)` for pending/attention states
- **Accent Color**: Vibrant Blue `oklch(0.60 0.20 220)` - attention-grabbing highlight for CTAs and active queue status
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**: 
  - Background `oklch(0.98 0.01 240)`: Dark text `oklch(0.20 0.02 240)` - Ratio 15.8:1 ✓
  - Card `oklch(1 0 0)`: Primary text `oklch(0.20 0.02 240)` - Ratio 16.4:1 ✓  
  - Primary `oklch(0.45 0.15 240)`: White text `oklch(1 0 0)` - Ratio 8.2:1 ✓
  - Secondary `oklch(0.55 0.12 140)`: White text `oklch(1 0 0)` - Ratio 5.1:1 ✓
  - Accent `oklch(0.60 0.20 220)`: White text `oklch(1 0 0)` - Ratio 4.6:1 ✓

## Font Selection

Typography should convey clarity, authority, and multilingual support for Arabic and English text with proper RTL handling.

- **Typographic Hierarchy**: 
  - H1 (Page Titles): Cairo Bold/32px/tight letter spacing for Arabic headings
  - H2 (Section Headers): Cairo SemiBold/24px/normal spacing for subsections  
  - H3 (Component Titles): Cairo Medium/18px/normal spacing for cards and forms
  - Body Text: Cairo Regular/16px/relaxed line height for optimal Arabic readability
  - Caption: Cairo Light/14px/normal spacing for metadata and timestamps

## Animations

Animations should feel purposeful and efficient - supporting the system's professional educational context without appearing frivolous, with subtle transitions that guide user attention to critical status changes.

- **Purposeful Meaning**: Motion communicates system reliability and real-time responsiveness through smooth state transitions
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Critical status changes (queue position, approval status) receive prominent animation focus while secondary actions use subtle micro-interactions

## Component Selection

- **Components**: Dialog for approval workflows, Cards for student/request display, Forms with proper validation for dismissal requests, Tabs for different user views, Alert components for status notifications, Progress indicators for queue position, Badge components for status display
- **Customizations**: Custom queue position indicator component, Real-time status cards with animated updates, Arabic-optimized form layouts with RTL support
- **States**: Buttons need distinct states for request submission (loading, success, error), Interactive cards show hover/selected states for student selection, Form inputs provide clear validation feedback in Arabic
- **Icon Selection**: Users, Clock, MapPin, Bell, CheckCircle, XCircle, AlertTriangle for clear status communication
- **Spacing**: Consistent 16px base unit with generous padding for touch targets, 24px margins between major sections
- **Mobile**: Mobile-first responsive design with collapsible navigation, Cards stack vertically on mobile with full-width buttons, Touch-optimized spacing of 44px minimum for interactive elements
